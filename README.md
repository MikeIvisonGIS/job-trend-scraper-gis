# job-trend-scraper-gis
 Web scraper that performs a job search on LinkedIn, scrapes job descriptions, keeps a count of keywords, and writes final total to a .txt

To run the script successfully, the user will need to do two things:
   1. Create a .txt for the printToDocument function to append results to
   2. Update the file variable in the printToDocument function to reflect the correct file path
